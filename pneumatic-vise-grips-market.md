<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Vise Grips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Action</li><li>Double-Action</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic vise grips are specialized tools used for clamping and holding workpieces in various industrial applications. The market is divided into two main types: single-action and double-action. Single-action grips operate with a single press of the trigger, engaging the jaw for straightforward clamping tasks. In contrast, double-action vise grips require two actions—one for gripping and another for releasing—offering increased precision and control. Both types enhance efficiency and safety in tasks requiring firm clamping, catering to diverse user needs.</p></p>
