<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrolyzed Casein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Instant Miscellar Casein</li><li>Miscellar Casein</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrolyzed casein market can be categorized into two main types: instant micellar casein and micellar casein. Instant micellar casein is processed to dissolve quickly in liquids, making it ideal for protein supplements and food products that require rapid mixing. On the other hand, micellar casein is a slower-digesting protein, absorbed gradually, which helps in muscle recovery and sustained amino acid release. Both types are valued for their nutritional benefits in sports nutrition, health foods, and functional beverages.</p></p>
