<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescence Spectrophotometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam Type</li><li>Double Beam Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fluorescence spectrophotometer market is divided into two primary types: single beam and double beam. Single beam spectrophotometers measure fluorescence by directing light through a single path, simplifying the design and making them typically more cost-effective. In contrast, double beam spectrophotometers use two light paths—one for the sample and another for a reference—allowing for improved accuracy and stability in measurements. Both types find applications in various fields, including research, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring, based on specific analytical needs.</p></p>
