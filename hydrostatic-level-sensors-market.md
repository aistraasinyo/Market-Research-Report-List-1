<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrostatic Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Switch Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrostatic level sensors market is primarily categorized into two types: switch type and continuous type. Switch type sensors offer discrete level detection, providing on/off signals when the liquid reaches a predetermined level, ideal for applications requiring simple level monitoring. In contrast, continuous type sensors deliver real-time level measurements, outputting variable signals proportional to the liquid level. This makes them suitable for applications needing precise, ongoing monitoring, such as in water treatment and industrial processes. Both types serve critical roles in fluid level management.</p></p>
